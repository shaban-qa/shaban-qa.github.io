sections:
- deliverable: Test plan with coverage matrix and priority page checklist.
  example: "Scope:\n\t• Desktop and mobile browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge\n\
    \t• Pages: homepage, registration, login, dashboard, search, checkout\n\t• Functional,\
    \ compatibility, UI/UX and error validation\n\nEnvironments:\n\t• Staging with\
    \ CDN and auth configured\n\t• Mobile viewports simulated + tested on real devices\n\
    \nTools:\n\t• Chrome DevTools for debugging and performance traces\n\t• BrowserStack\
    \ for real-device browser tests\n\t• Postman for backend integration checks\n\n\
    Risks:\n\t• DOM rendering differences between Safari/Firefox\n\t• Layout breakage\
    \ on mobile viewports\n\t• Form validation inconsistencies across browsers"
  objective: To define the goals, browser matrix, environments, and strategy for cross-browser
    and functional web testing.
  title: 1. Test Planning
- deliverable: Test case suite with annotated screenshots and browser-specific flags.
  example: "Case Types:\n\t• Navigation: homepage → login → dashboard\n\t• Form handling:\
    \ validation messages, input limits, tab flow\n\t• API integration: verify front-to-back\
    \ data sync\n\t• Responsiveness: resizing and mobile-first layouts\n\nEdge Cases:\n\
    \t• Typing invalid emails, empty fields\n\t• Resizing during form input\n\t• Cached\
    \ login state and logout behavior\n\nTools:\n\t• Test cases in Notion/TestRail\n\
    \t• DevTools + Lighthouse used during test writing"
  objective: To create structured test cases that validate key user journeys, UI behavior,
    and backend integration on multiple browsers.
  title: 2. Test Case Design
- deliverable: Bug report document with 15+ tracked issues and browser evidence.
  example: "Execution:\n\t• Manual runs on Chrome, Firefox, Edge (desktop)\n\t• BrowserStack\
    \ for iOS Safari + Android Chrome\n\t• UI checked against Figma design\n\nBug\
    \ Reporting:\n\t• Logged in Trello + screenshots + video when needed\n\t• Labeled\
    \ by device, browser, priority\n\t• Issues grouped by feature/module"
  objective: To execute test flows across target browsers and devices and capture
    visual, functional, and integration bugs.
  title: 3. Execution & Bug Reporting
- deliverable: Security findings summary + token/session validation notes.
  example: "Checks:\n\t• Token behavior (storage in cookie/localStorage)\n\t• 403\
    \ for expired/invalid JWTs\n\t• Input encoding for script injection (XSS)\n\t\
    • URL tampering (direct access to /admin)\n\nTools:\n\t• DevTools → Application\
    \ tab\n\t• Incognito/private tabs for state isolation"
  objective: To verify secure login/logout flow, session timeout, error handling,
    and input sanitization on all browsers.
  title: 4. Authentication & Security
- deliverable: Lighthouse report, JS/CSS analysis, and frontend speed profile.
  example: "Frontend Metrics:\n\t• First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful\
    \ Paint (LCP)\n\t• Time to Interactive (TTI), CLS\n\t• Lighthouse performance\
    \ score tracked\n\nLoad Checks:\n\t• API response stability under parallel tab\
    \ usage\n\t• Static assets via CDN validation\n\t• JS bundle size monitored\n\n\
    Observations:\n\t• Login page FCP = 1.8s, CLS = 0.01\n\t• Search API degraded\
    \ with 5+ active users"
  objective: To analyze frontend performance, detect bottlenecks, and validate load
    behavior under real and simulated conditions.
  title: 5. Performance & Load Testing
- deliverable: Final QA report archive with browser-specific feedback and visual logs.
  example: "Summary:\n\t• Cross-browser UI passed with minor alignment issues on Edge\n\
    \t• 3 high-priority bugs fixed during test cycle\n\t• Checkout tested with live\
    \ test card\n\nRecommendations:\n\t1. Refactor form validation for Safari\n\t\
    2. Add fallback for mobile navigation menu\n\t3. Review layout breakpoints for\
    \ <360px viewports\n\nDeliverables:\n\t• ✅ PDF Test Summary\n\t• \U0001F4F8 Screenshots\
    \ archive\n\t• \U0001F4C1 Browser log exports"
  objective: To provide a consolidated report of all test results with actionable
    fixes and browser-specific improvement plans.
