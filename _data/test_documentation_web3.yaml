sections:
- deliverable: Test scope, network matrix, wallet setup guide, and critical user path
    outline.
  example: "Scope:\n\t• Web3 app UI + wallet connection + smart contract interaction\n\
    \t• Networks: Ethereum (testnet), Polygon, BSC\n\t• Metamask, WalletConnect, and\
    \ fallback flows\n\nEnvironment:\n\t• Staging frontend with smart contracts on\
    \ Goerli\n\t• Faucet-configured test wallets for repeatability\n\nTools:\n\t•\
    \ MetaMask (Chrome extension), Hardhat (for mocks)\n\t• Remix IDE for direct contract\
    \ invocation\n\t• DevTools + etherscan for tx validation\n\nRisks:\n\t• Wallet\
    \ rejection or transaction failures\n\t• Out-of-gas errors or long confirmations\n\
    \t• State desync between UI and blockchain"
  objective: To define the scope, tools, blockchain networks, and environment setup
    for testing dApps and smart contract flows.
  title: 1. Test Planning
- deliverable: Test case library with success/failure outcomes and wallet state checkpoints.
  example: "Test Scenarios:\n\t• Connect/disconnect wallet with Metamask\n\t• Mint\
    \ NFT (if enough balance)\n\t• Attempt mint with 0 balance\n\t• Transaction rejection\
    \ from user side\n\t• Gas estimation failure or underpriced gas\n\nEdge Cases:\n\
    \t• Switching networks during tx\n\t• Rapid repeat clicks on confirm\n\t• Contract\
    \ revert and UI sync check\n\nDesign Tools:\n\t• Gherkin syntax for scenario writing\n\
    \t• Pre-conditions include wallet state, token approvals"
  objective: To define scenarios that cover transaction flows, wallet behavior, edge
    cases, and smart contract response handling.
  title: 2. Test Case Design
- deliverable: Chain-specific bug list with screenshots, tx hashes, and smart contract
    logs.
  example: "Execution:\n\t• Ran tests on Goerli (ETH), Mumbai (Polygon), and local\
    \ Hardhat\n\t• Verified UI vs chain explorer data\n\t• Metamask events traced\
    \ (sign, reject, confirm)\n\nBug Reporting:\n\t• UI shows tx success before confirmation\n\
    \t• Incorrect gas limit default → failed mint\n\t• Etherscan shows status fail\
    \ while UI shows success"
  objective: To perform tests on different chains, capture behavior for each wallet
    action, and report blockchain-specific bugs.
  title: 3. Execution & Bug Reporting
- deliverable: Security test report for signing, access control, and nonce handling
    coverage.
  example: "Checks:\n\t• Signature request → verify signer address match\n\t• Replay\
    \ protection (nonce handling)\n\t• Unauthorized access via bypassed frontend\n\
    \t• UI locked until wallet connection\n\nSecurity Tools:\n\t• Hardhat console\
    \ logs\n\t• Ethers.js for message hash verification"
  objective: To validate wallet-based auth, message signing flows, replay protection,
    and permission boundaries.
  title: 4. Authentication & Security
- deliverable: Gas usage table, UI wait time audit, and RPC response comparison.
  example: "Tests Run:\n\t• Gas usage per mint, per approval\n\t• Confirmation time\
    \ across chains (Goerli: 15s avg)\n\t• UI feedback latency simulation (slow RPC\
    \ + devtools throttle)\n\nFindings:\n\t• Polygon txs faster but error handling\
    \ weaker\n\t• User double-clicked confirm due to no feedback\n\t• Loading spinner\
    \ missing for pending tx"
  objective: To monitor transaction latency, gas usage, and UX under delayed confirmations
    or slow RPC responses.
  title: 5. Performance & Load Testing
- deliverable: Web3 QA report with chain coverage, bug insights, and wallet UX review.
  example: "Summary:\n\t• All wallet flows work on ETH and Polygon\n\t• 4 smart contract\
    \ revert cases uncovered\n\t• UX flow broke when user switched networks\n\nRecommendations:\n\
    \t1. Add loader and tx status indicators\n\t2. Delay UI success until confirmed\n\
    \t3. Precheck balance/gas before enable buttons\n\nDeliverables:\n\t• ✅ Full QA\
    \ report\n\t• \U0001F9EA Chain-by-chain matrix\n\t• \U0001F510 Security checklist\
    \ PDF"
  objective: To summarize the testing results across chains and provide actionable
    recommendations for security, UX, and stability.
