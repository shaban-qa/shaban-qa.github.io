- deliverable: Performance test strategy, tool configuration, and baseline metrics
    sheet.
  example: "Scope & Focus:\n\t• Backend/API endpoints (GET/POST), homepage, login,\
    \ product listing\n\t• Key user flows: search, filter, checkout\n\t• Stress, load,\
    \ spike, and endurance tests\n\nEnvironment Setup:\n\t• Staging env with production\
    \ parity (CPU, memory, network latency)\n\t• Baseline defined for response time\
    \ and throughput\n\nTooling:\n\t• Apache JMeter for test execution\n\t• Browser\
    \ DevTools for frontend rendering metrics\n\t• Postman + Newman for quick endpoint\
    \ validation\n\nRisk Areas:\n\t• DB query latency\n\t• Rate limiting & 429 behavior\n\
    \t• Cache invalidation impacts under load"
  objective: To define the performance objectives, test environments, tools, and scope
    for simulating realistic load and identifying system bottlenecks. The planning
    ensures consistency, measurability, and business alignment.
  title: 1. Test Planning
- deliverable: 5 scenario-based test scripts with user load profiles and data input
    sets.
  example: "Test Scenarios:\n\t• 100 concurrent users logging in and browsing\n\t\
    • 50 users applying filters and loading paginated results\n\t• Checkout during\
    \ high load (200 TPS)\n\nData-Driven Design:\n\t• CSV dataset for dynamic users\
    \ and product IDs\n\t• Parameterization of login payloads and auth tokens\n\n\
    JMeter Configuration:\n\t• Thread groups for user simulation\n\t• Ramp-up settings\
    \ and loop controllers\n\t• Think time and timers to mimic real behavior"
  objective: To define scenarios that simulate concurrent user activity with variable
    loads, data inputs, and request bursts.
  title: 2. Test Case Design
- deliverable: Execution log, JMeter HTML report, and bug list with root cause hypotheses.
  example: "Execution Summary:\n\t• Simulated 1000 users over 10 minutes (JMeter CLI)\n\
    \t• Collected metrics: avg/max response time, error %, hits/sec\n\t• Logged server\
    \ CPU/RAM stats during tests\n\nBug Reporting:\n\t• Detected DB lock during spike\
    \ test\n\t• Found 503 errors on 5% of login attempts under 800 TPS\n\t• JMeter\
    \ report screenshots + error stack traces included"
  objective: To run designed test scripts, capture response time, errors, and server
    behavior under load; and document issues clearly.
  title: 3. Execution & Bug Reporting
- deliverable: Security validation log during load tests + summary of auth edge case
    results.
  example: "Checks Performed:\n\t• Token expiration and refresh under high load\n\t\
    • Repeated login attempts by same user (concurrency handling)\n\t• Session invalidation\
    \ on logout\n\nFindings:\n\t• No token leakage observed\n\t• 401 and 403 returned\
    \ correctly when rate limits triggered\n\t• Auth system handled 3000+ concurrent\
    \ tokens"
  objective: To ensure secure session management and consistent authentication behavior
    under load and concurrent sessions.
  title: 4. Authentication & Security
- deliverable: Performance dashboard, latency graph, and SLA deviation summary.
  example: "Metrics Captured:\n\t• Avg response time (ms), throughput (req/sec), error\
    \ %\n\t• 90th percentile latency for key flows\n\t• Resource utilization: CPU,\
    \ memory, disk I/O\n\nResult Highlights:\n\t• 90% of homepage loads < 2.5s\n\t\
    • 5% checkout failure under 500+ concurrent users\n\t• DB spikes during cache\
    \ purge observed"
  objective: To collect quantitative performance metrics under realistic usage scenarios
    and identify system limits.
  title: 5. Performance & Load Testing
- deliverable: Final report with dashboards, logs, and priority-based improvement
    plan.
  example: "Summary:\n\t• All endpoints stable up to 300 users\n\t• Checkout flow\
    \ degraded at 400+ users\n\t• DB query optimizations recommended for heavy filters\n\
    \nRecommendations:\n\t1. Add Redis caching for product search\n\t2. Implement\
    \ async DB calls in filters API\n\t3. Use CDN for image-heavy pages\n\nDeliverables:\n\
    \t• \U0001F4CA Full test report (HTML)\n\t• \U0001F4C1 Config files and data sets\n\
    \t• ✅ Recommendations in executive summary"
  objective: To consolidate all performance results and provide stakeholders with
    clear recommendations on scaling, optimization, and next steps.
