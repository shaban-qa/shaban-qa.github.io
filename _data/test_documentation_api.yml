sections:
  - title: 1. Test Planning
    objective: >-
      To define the scope, strategy, resources, and schedule for API testing
      using Postman. This ensures that the testing process is systematic,
      efficient, and focused on business-critical endpoints.
    example: "Scope & Focus:\n\t•\tRESTful API endpoints related to user authentication, CRUD operations, filtering, and data validation.\n\t•\tCoverage includes both positive and negative scenarios.\n\nRequirements & Environment:\n\t•\tBusiness and technical requirements gathered from documentation and stakeholder inputs.\n\t•\tExpected outcomes defined: HTTP status codes, response time thresholds, JSON structure compliance.\n\t•\tTesting conducted in staging environment simulating production behavior.\n\nTools & Strategy:\n\t•\tPostman used as the primary tool for manual and semi-automated testing.\n\t•\tTest collections designed to validate functional correctness and API resilience.\n\t•\tTest data controlled via environment variables in Postman (e.g., auth tokens, user IDs, payloads).\n\nTest Coverage Includes:\n\t•\tSuccess and failure scenarios (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized)\n•\tTimeout handling and invalid payload injection\n•\tAuthentication and authorization flow testing\n•\tResponse structure validation with built-in Postman scripts\n\nRisk Areas:\n•\tEndpoints with state-changing actions (POST/PUT/DELETE)\n•\tToken-based authentication (expiration, refresh logic)\n•\tRate limiting or throttling behavior (if implemented)"
    deliverable: Test plan with 18 test cases.
  - title: 2. Test Case Design
    objective: >-
      To create structured, repeatable test cases that validate each API
      endpoint’s functionality, error handling, and edge case behavior.
    example: "Design Principles:\n\t•\tBased on API documentation, business logic, and expected user workflows.\n\t•\tAligned with best practices of black-box and negative testing.\n\t•\tFocused on data-driven input variations and validation of output schemas.\n\nTest Structure:\nEach endpoint is tested with the following case types:\n\n\t•\tPositive tests — verifying correct behavior with valid inputs.\n\t•\tNegative tests — checking system response to missing/invalid data, unauthorized access.\n\t•\tEdge cases — oversized payloads, empty strings, boundary values.\n\t•\tSecurity-related tests — testing access with invalid/missing tokens, ID tampering, etc.\n\nExample Breakdown:\nEndpoint: POST /api/login\n- ✅ Valid credentials → 200 OK + token\n- ❌ Missing email field → 400 Bad Request\n- ❌ Wrong password → 401 Unauthorized\n- ❌ SQL injection string → input sanitized, 400/403\n\nPostman Implementation:\n\t•\tTest cases organized as folders within a Postman Collection.\n\t•\tEach request includes:\n\t•\tPre-request scripts (e.g., token injection)\n\t•\tEnvironment variables (dynamic data substitution)\n\t•\tTest scripts (status code, schema validation, performance metrics)"
  - title: 3. Execution & Bug Reporting
    objective: >-
      To execute defined test cases using Postman and document all discovered
      issues in a format that enables quick triage and resolution by the
      development team.
    example: "Test Execution Process:\n•\tManual execution of each API request using Postman Collection Runner.\n•\tDynamic data injection via environment variables.\n•\tAutomated scripts validated:\n•\tHTTP status codes\n•\tResponse time (≤ 2s threshold)\n•\tJSON body structure and expected fields\n•\tError messages and code consistency\n\nError Classification:\nBugs are categorized by severity:\n•\tCritical — system crashes, security breaches, broken core functionality.\n•\tMajor — major deviations from business logic or spec.\n•\tMinor — cosmetic, message inconsistencies, typos.\n\nBug Report Template:\nEach defect is documented in a structured format:\nTitle: [API] /login returns 200 on invalid credentials\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Send POST /api/login with incorrect password\n2. Observe response\n\nExpected Result:\nShould return 401 Unauthorized with error message\n\nActual Result:\nReturns 200 OK with empty response\n\nEvidence:\n- Screenshot / JSON response\n- Response time: 75ms\n- Curl reproduction command\n\nReporting Tools:\n\t•\tBug tracker: Jira / Notion / Trello (based on client preference)\n\t•\tOptional: Direct GitHub issue creation (linked to API spec)\n\t•\tBugs labeled with tags like @security, @backend, @auth, @critical\n\nCommunication:\n\t•\tDefects are reviewed during QA handoff or via async dev channels (Slack/Discord)\n\t•\tLive demo sessions can be scheduled to walk through critical issues"
  - title: 4. Authentication & Security
    objective: >-
      To ensure that the API enforces proper access control, handles
      authentication tokens securely, and protects sensitive operations against
      unauthorized access or common vulnerabilities.
    example: "Authentication Checks:\n•\tTested token-based authentication via Bearer Tokens in headers.\n•\tVerified correct handling of:\n•\tMissing or expired tokens → should return 401 Unauthorized\n•\tTampered or malformed tokens → should return 403 Forbidden or error\n•\tRole-based access to protected endpoints (if implemented)\n\nAuthorization Scenarios:\n•\tTried accessing endpoints meant for specific users using tokens of other accounts.\n•\tConfirmed that cross-user access attempts return permission errors or empty responses (depending on design).\n\nSecurity Scenarios Tested:\n\t•\tRate Limiting: multiple rapid requests to check for throttling behavior (status 429 Too Many Requests if enabled)\n\t•\tInjection Attacks:\n\t•\tSQL/NoSQL-like payloads injected into request body/query params\n\t•\tExpected proper sanitization or rejection without server-side crash\n\t•\tHeader Manipulation:\n\t•\tModified Content-Type, User-Agent, and Origin headers to detect misconfigurations\n\nSecurity Headers Validation:\n\t•\tEnsured presence of key headers (where applicable):\n\t•\tX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n\t•\tStrict-Transport-Security\n\t•\tAccess-Control-Allow-Origin\n\nTooling & Techniques:\n\t•\tManual inspection via Postman & DevTools\n\t•\tHeader inspection with curl and proxy tools (e.g., Charles)\n\t•\tBaseline threat modeling based on OWASP API Security Top 10\n\nKey Outcomes:\n\t•\tAll protected routes return appropriate HTTP codes for unauthorized access\n\t•\tNo sensitive data leakage through error messages\n\t•\tAPI gracefully handles malformed input and invalid tokens"
  - title: 5. Performance & Load Testing
    objective: >-
      To assess the responsiveness, stability, and efficiency of the API under
      repeated usage and simulated load scenarios.
    example: "Testing Strategy:\n\t•\tFocused on evaluating how the API handles multiple requests in a short time frame.\n\t•\tVerified average response time, error rate, and potential bottlenecks in frequently used endpoints.\n\nTools Used:\n\t•\tPostman Runner: ran complete collections with real-time monitoring\n\t•\tNewman CLI: executed automated test suites in bulk (100+ requests/session)\n\t•\tCustom Scripts: recorded response time and assertion results per iteration\n\nScenarios Simulated:\n\t•\tSequential and parallel execution of:\n\t•\tGET /items\n\t•\tPOST /login\n\t•\tPUT /update-profile\n\t•\tRepeated runs (5–10 iterations per test case) to mimic light-load stress testing\n\nMetrics Collected:\n\n\t•\tAverage response time:\nMeasured per endpoint — most stable endpoints stayed below 500ms\n\t•\tError rate (%):\nCalculated based on assertion failures and unexpected status codes\n\t•\tTimeouts or delays:\nFlagged endpoints taking longer than 2 seconds or spiking under load\n\nObservations:\n\t•\tAll endpoints responded consistently under moderate load\n\t•\tNo significant degradation or dropped connections during 100+ consecutive requests\n\t•\tRecommendations provided for endpoints exceeding baseline expectations\n\nRecommendations:\n\t•\tIntroduce server-side caching for read-heavy endpoints\n\t•\tMonitor database query latency for slower responses\n\t•\tConsider implementing rate limiting if open to public access"
  - title: 6. Final Report & Recommendations
    objective: >-
      To summarize the API testing results, highlight identified issues, and
      provide actionable recommendations to improve system quality and readiness
      for production.
