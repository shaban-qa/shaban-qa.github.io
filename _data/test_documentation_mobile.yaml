sections:
- deliverable: Test plan with device coverage table and 24 test scenarios across platforms.
  example: "Scope & Coverage:\n\t• Native mobile application (Android, iOS)\n\t• Installation,\
    \ launch, onboarding, core functionality, notifications\n\t• Device-specific features\
    \ (camera, GPS, biometrics)\n\nRequirements & Environment:\n\t• Test environments\
    \ set for iOS (13–17), Android (9–14)\n\t• Focus on both manual (real devices)\
    \ and emulator-based testing\n\t• Screen resolution and OS version matrix defined\n\
    \nTest Strategy:\n\t• Functional testing, interrupt testing (calls, SMS), UX testing\n\
    \t• Checklists and test cases organized in test suites\n\t• Focus on critical\
    \ path and exploratory testing\n\nRisk Areas:\n\t• Device fragmentation\n\t• Network\
    \ switching / offline modes\n\t• Inconsistent platform behavior (iOS vs Android)"
  objective: To define the scope, strategy, devices, and schedule for mobile application
    testing across Android and iOS platforms. This ensures systematic validation of
    app stability, usability, and responsiveness across real devices and emulators.
  title: 1. Test Planning
- deliverable: Test case suite covering 90% of business-critical paths and edge-device
    behavior.
  example: "Design Focus:\n\t• Based on user flows: login, navigation, feature use,\
    \ push notification\n\t• Edge cases: incoming call during form submission, orientation\
    \ change\n\nTypes of Test Cases:\n\t• UI validation across screen sizes\n\t• Touch\
    \ gestures: swipe, tap, long press\n\t• Background/foreground transitions\n\t\
    • App permission dialogs (GPS, camera, contacts)\n\nTools:\n\t• Google Sheets\
    \ or TestRail for structured TCs\n\t• Screenshots & expected/actual results logged\
    \ for each case"
  objective: To create structured test cases simulating real-world user interactions
    and mobile-specific conditions.
  title: 2. Test Case Design
- deliverable: Bug report with 7 unique issues, 3 critical crashes, and video proof
    of edge-case failures.
  example: "Execution:\n\t• Used physical devices (iPhone 12, Samsung S22) and emulators\
    \ (Pixel 4, iPhone SE)\n\t• Functional flows tested under WiFi and 3G/4G\n\t•\
    \ Interrupt tests: incoming call, airplane mode, low battery\n\nBug Reporting:\n\
    \t• Logged via Notion + screenshots + screen recordings\n\t• Report includes device/OS\
    \ version, app version, steps, expected vs actual\n\t• Prioritized as Critical,\
    \ Major, Minor"
  objective: To execute test cases on real devices and emulators, capture app behavior,
    and document defects in a traceable format.
  title: 3. Execution & Bug Reporting
- deliverable: Security checklist + session handling validation across 4 auth paths.
  example: "Checks Performed:\n\t• Secure storage of tokens (Keychain/Keystore)\n\t\
    • Expired token behavior (forced logout)\n\t• Access control for unauthorized\
    \ users\n\t• Device biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) fallback paths\n\nSecurity\
    \ Review:\n\t• App does not log sensitive info\n\t• Tested jailbroken/rooted devices\
    \ to detect insecure behavior"
  objective: To verify secure handling of user credentials, session tokens, and device-level
    permission requests.
  title: 4. Authentication & Security
- deliverable: 'Performance report: 3s cold start, 95% smooth scroll, 70MB RAM on
    avg, no crashes under pressure.'
  example: "Tests Conducted:\n\t• Cold start and warm start timing (under 3s target)\n\
    \t• Scrolling smoothness on low-end Android\n\t• App size and memory usage profile\n\
    \t• Monitored ANRs, dropped frames, battery usage with profiler tools"
  objective: To measure the app’s responsiveness, launch time, and behavior under
    constrained resources (CPU, RAM, battery).
  title: 5. Performance & Load Testing
- deliverable: Final QA package with all reports, crash videos, and device logs
  example: "Findings Summary:\n\t• App passed core functionality and UI validation\
    \ on 5 target devices\n\t• 3 critical bugs found, all reproducible\n\t• UX inconsistency\
    \ on Android dark mode\n\nRecommendations:\n\t1. Optimize onboarding for one-hand\
    \ usage\n\t2. Improve dark mode color contrast\n\t3. Re-test on Android 14 once\
    \ stable\n\nDeliverables Provided:\n\t• \U0001F4C4 Full test report (PDF)\n\t\
    • \U0001F3A5 Crash video logs\n\t• ✅ Signed device compatibility matrix"
  objective: To deliver a comprehensive summary of test results, highlight risks,
    and suggest improvements prior to store release.
