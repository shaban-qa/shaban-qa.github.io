  - title: "1. Test Planning"
    objective: "Define endpoints, methods, and test scope."
    example: "We targeted 5 endpoints: /users, /tasks, /auth, testing GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with valid/invalid inputs."
    deliverable: "Test plan with 18 test cases."

  - title: "2. Test Case Design"

      - Expected: 200 OK, JSON array.
      - Result: ✅ Pass (150ms).

  - title: "3. Execution & Bug Reporting"
    objective: "Run tests, log issues with details."
    example: |
      TC-002:
